# Guess My Number

This is a simple number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 99 with the least possible number of attempts. The user can input a number and click the 'Check' button to see if it matches the randomly generated number. If the number is correct, the user wins the game, and their score is updated.
